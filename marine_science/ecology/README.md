- Ecosystem stability metrics

## Usage

Each module contains detailed documentation and example usage. See individual module READMEs for specific instructions.

## Data Requirements

The modules are designed to work with common ecological data types:
- Species occurrence data
- Abundance data
- Environmental variables
- Temporal series
- Spatial data

## Dependencies
